## Description 

The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

As a developing web coder, the SVG Logo Maker project challenged me to learn more about Node.js, the command-line interface, and SVG file format. By completing this project, I gained practical experience with key web development technologies such as Node.js, inquirer, and SVG graphics.

In addition to building a functional command-line application, this project helped me develop problem-solving skills and the ability to work with both front-end and back-end technologies. Overall, completing the SVG Logo Maker project was an important step in my development as a web coder and prepared me for future web development challenges.
